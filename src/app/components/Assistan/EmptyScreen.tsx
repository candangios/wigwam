          MachinaFi is the first-ever Web3 AI model, entirely built and owned by
          the TON community, and brought to life by 1chain.AI. This
          groundbreaking model gives TON users the unique power to train, engage
          with, and benefit directly from a decentralized AI—an AI that learns
          and grows from real community interactions. By participating, users
          don’t just passively use AI; they actively shape and own a part of the
          future of decentralized intelligence, with the chance to unlock
          exclusive rewards. Early adopters will play a vital role in developing
          MachinaFi’s intelligence and capabilities, potentially gaining even
          greater benefits as the ecosystem expands.
