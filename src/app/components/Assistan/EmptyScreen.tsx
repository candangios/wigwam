          1chainâ€™s Web3 AI Agent Protocol (WAAP) is designed to embed AI
          assistants into dApps, enabling users to perform complex blockchain
          tasks through simple chat commands. These AI assistants use Large
          Language Models (LLMs) to create specialized AI models that can
          communicate with crypto infrastructures, protocols, and apps to
          execute tasks easily, securely, and efficiently for new users. These
          specialized models, known as Large Action Models (LAMs), revolutionize
          the user experience in the crypto space, making it incredibly
          straightforward and accessible, thus driving mass crypto adoption.
